**By using KTM EduTech by Kyd Tantano Masong ("KTM EduTech," "I," "my," or "me"), you agree to the following terms:**

1. **Services Provided**  
   I offer web development, private tutoring, and system maintenance & support services. These services are delivered as agreed upon between you and me, primarily conducted within Thailand, unless explicitly agreed otherwise. Each project or service engagement will be defined by a separate agreement or contract outlining specific deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities.

2. **Payments**  
   I accept payments through PayPal, Payoneer, and bank transfers within Thailand. Full payment details are provided through Zoho Invoice, where clients can access their portal for invoicing and service tracking. All payments must be made in the currency specified on the invoice, and clients are responsible for any transaction fees incurred.

3. **Refund Policy**  
   Refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the service provided and any prior agreements made. Requests for refunds must be submitted within 14 days of the completion of the service. Refunds, if approved, will be processed within 30 days. Certain services, such as customized web development and consulting, may not be eligible for refunds.

4. **Intellectual Property**  
   All content on this website, including project portfolios (e.g., ICT Click Digital Media for Educators, Learners, and Developers), remains my intellectual property unless otherwise stated. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any content without my prior written consent. Any content provided to you as part of a service remains my intellectual property until full payment is received.

6. **Confidentiality**  
   I respect your privacy and confidentiality. Any sensitive information shared during our engagements will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent, except as required by law. You also agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information shared by me during our engagement.

7. **Limitations of Liability**  
   I strive to provide accurate and quality services, but I cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to my website or services.

9. **Termination of Services**  
   I reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to my services at any time, without prior notice, for conduct that I believe violates these Terms and Conditions, is harmful to other users, or is otherwise unlawful.
