                        >By using KTM EduTech by Kyd Tantano Masong ("KTM EduTech," "I," "my," or "me"), you agree to
                        the following terms:</strong
                    >
                </p>

                <h3>1. Services Provided</h3>
                <p>
                    I offer web development, private tutoring, and system maintenance & support services. These services
                    are delivered as agreed upon between you and me, primarily conducted within Thailand, unless
                    explicitly agreed otherwise. Each project or service engagement will be defined by a separate
                    agreement or contract outlining specific deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Payments</h3>
                <p>
                    I accept payments through PayPal, Payoneer, and bank transfers within Thailand. Full payment details
                    are provided through Zoho Invoice, where clients can access their portal for invoicing and service
                    tracking. All payments must be made in the currency specified on the invoice, and clients are
                    responsible for any transaction fees incurred.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the service provided and
                    any prior agreements made. Requests for refunds must be submitted within 14 days of the completion
                    of the service. Refunds, if approved, will be processed within 30 days. Certain services, such as
                    customized web development and consulting, may not be eligible for refunds.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>
                    All content on this website, including project portfolios (e.g., ICT Click Digital Media for
                    Educators, Learners, and Developers), remains my intellectual property unless otherwise stated. You
                    may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any content without my prior written
                    consent. Any content provided to you as part of a service remains my intellectual property until
                    full payment is received.
                </p>

                <h3>5. User Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>As a user of my website and services, you agree to:</p>

                    <li>Use my services and website in a lawful manner, respecting the rights of others.</li>
                    <li>
                        Refrain from using my services for any unauthorized or illegal activities, including but not
                        limited to hacking, spamming, or distributing malware.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>
                    I respect your privacy and confidentiality. Any sensitive information shared during our engagements
                    will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent, except as
                    required by law. You also agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information
                    shared by me during our engagement.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Limitations of Liability</h3>
                <p>
                    I strive to provide accurate and quality services, but I cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to my
                    website or services. I am not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
                    resulting from the use of this website or my services. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of
                    data, loss of profits, or any business interruption.
                </p>

                <h3>8. Indemnification</h3>
                <p>
                    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless KTM EduTech, by Kyd Tantano Masong, and any affiliates,
                    employees, or partners from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses arising from your
                    use of my services, violation of these terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Termination of Services</h3>
                <p>
                    I reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to my services at any time, without prior notice,
                    for conduct that I believe violates these Terms and Conditions, is harmful to other users, or is
                    otherwise unlawful.
                </p>

                <h3>10. Legal Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p>
                    This agreement is governed by the laws of Thailand. Any disputes will be resolved within the
                    jurisdiction of Thai courts. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
                    unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <h3>11. Amendments</h3>
                <p>
                    I reserve the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Any changes will be posted on
                    this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the website or services after
                    any modifications indicate your acceptance of the new terms.
                </p>
